# "Reach for the Sky"

**Analyst:** Taylor Morton

## Business Problem

In 1995, Pixar created one of its first and most successful animated films following a rag tag group of toys who navigate through the life of their loving owner, Andy. The film entitled "Toy Story" has grown to become one of the most beloved animated films in history. Woody, the protagonist of the film has an adventureous saying when the string on his back is pulled called "Reach for the Sky!". This often signals his drive for adventure and navigating new terrain in Andy's life, and with his toy companions.

Microsoft is one of the oldest leaders in technology and innovation, and is more than capable of capturing the film world in the future. With this leading edge, I will recommend how Microsoft can also "Reach for the Sky" and get the most out of their new film production company.

## Research Questions:

**Which release dates (months of the year) would I recommend to Microsoft for their new films?**

The release date of a movie can impact how many viewers it draws in, as well as whether or not it will be nominated for any renowned awards. A recent article from Variety speaks to the importance of release dates as it relates to the domestic box office, citing distribution, marketing, and production departments who use facts and figures to determine the best return on their investment (Variety 2019). In this analysis, we are focusing on release date, popularity, and vote average as variables of interest. 


**What genres of movies make the highest domestic gross income?** 

To understand how the type of movie could indicate an easy start of success for the company, we will look at domestic gross income and genre. Focusing on genre will allow Microsoft to better determine what type of movie to produce (action, documentary, animation ect...), by looking at which genres have brought in the most domestic income? In this analysis, we are focusing on domestic gross income, and genre as variables of interest. 

**Which studios should Microsoft further study to get a better understanding of what movies to produce? (comparing studio to domestic gross income)**

Having a better understanding of which studios have been most successful in making a higher domestic gross in their movies will give Microsoft an inclination on what further production models they should be researching for this branch of their company.

## Data Understanding

From the zipped data provided, I used imdb based csv files to narrow down three recommendations for upcoming movies. This data represents mainly movie genres, gross, budgets, and titles, but includes other variables including popularity, studios, release dates, production budgets and more. For these recommendations, the target variables were month of release dates, domestic gross, studios, and genres.

## Data Analysis 

**Data Analysis – Release Date and popularity**

- Retrieved information on what columns exist currently in the csv file 
- The ‘release date’ column was useful information considering that month of release is most useful to a production company
- Retrieved the most frequent month that movies were released (January) using mode
- Grouped my data by month, to get a clearer understanding of how the month of release date intersects with popularity

## Results & Conclusions

***
**Recommendations**
1. The Microsoft film release should take place in either **july, august, or december**.

In this bar plot, months 7 and 8 (July and August) have the second highest ratings of 3.5, with month 12 (December) having the highest rating of 4.0. 

2. **Animation** is the top genre recommendation for Microsoft's first film, however **sci-fi** and **adventure** could also be profitable. 

Animation, adventure, and science-fiction have significantly higher domestic gross incomes compared to other genres from this analysis. 

3. Microsoft should follow a model similar to **Pixar/Walt Disney studios** who have brought in the highest domestic gross from their films 

Pixar/Walt Disney in this analysis have made the highest domestic gross income in the data shown here. However, Buena Vista also has a very high domestic gross income. Buena Vista is also known to make well known animated films. 

**Key Takeaways and Future Studies** 

The limitations of this research center around not including the foreign gross from these films, and factoring in the production budget for these films. This particularly relates to recommendation 2 & 3 considering the costs and time that the production team will need to put into creating an animated film. 

Future studies should include a larger analysis on foreign gross, domestic gross, production budget, and return on income that each film in these data set has brought in. Further research and analysis could also be done on summer block buster movies and the return on investment that they offer to this work.
